# MPF-HyperNEAT

This is the source code for my master thesis 'Combining HyperNEAT and MPF to Create Adaptable Networks' written in the Spring and Summer of 2015 at the IT University of Copenhagen.

It combines elements from the Memory Prediction Framework with the evolutionary algorithm HyperNEAT.

The HyperNEAT implementation used is AHNI by Oliver Coleman (https://github.com/OliverColeman/ahni)

The code in this project includes the source code for AHNI. 
The additions created to make it work with the Memory Prediction Framework are in the package com.stcl.htm
